HYPRE BLAS README file

This is a subset of the CBLAS from netlib.org.
o The LAPACK/blas auxiliary routine xerbla_ has been
  renamed through this directory as hypre_xerbla_, to
  reduce name conflicts with the same routine in the
  HYPRE lapack directory.
o The LAPACK/blas auxiliary routine lsame_ has been
  renamed through this directory as hypre_lsame_, for
  the same reason as above.
o The routines xerbla_ and lsame_ have been moved into
  the blas_utils.c file.
