This tests two interfaces to PETSc: a level solver calls 'PetscSolver' and an AMR matrix construction class 'testPetscCompGrid'.
testPetscCompGrid.cpp tests the PetscCompGridPois class to create Jacobean for the Laplace(u) with Dirichlet BCs, and a PETSc solver to solve them.
testPetscSolver.cpp tests the Level solver class.
