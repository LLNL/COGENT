This example illustrates the use of the FAS Multigrid solver in Chombo for solving nonlinear problems. It is based on the execCell example which was written for the poisson equation.

For more details of the problem solved, see AMRFAS.pdf

To build the example:
make all DIM=<1,2,3> DEBUG=<TRUE,FALSE> OPT=<TRUE,FALSE,HIGH> MPI=<TRUE,FALSE>

To run the example:
FASSolve<config>.ex inputs

if compiled with HDF5, FASOut.<DIM>d.hdf5 will be written containing the RHS and the solution.

To run a convergence test:
python runTest.py

(you may need to change some of the parameters in the python script, e.g. the executable name)
