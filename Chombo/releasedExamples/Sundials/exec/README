This is a simple test of the Chombo-SUNDIALS interface.

Chombo contains an interface to the SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic Equation Solvers (SUNDIALS), which contains implementations of a number of sophisticated time-integration schemes which may be useful for Chombo applications.

To build this example with SUNDIALS,
1. Obtain the SUNDIALS source code and follow the SUNDIALS installation instructions: https://sundials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Install_link.html. We recommend using SUNDIALS version 6.3.0 which is compatible with C++11. If you are compiling Chombo with C++14, newer SUNDIALS versions can be used. Ensure the SUNDIALS_PRECISION CMake flag is consistent with the Chombo PRECISION.
2. Set the SUNDIALS_DIR environment variable to point to your SUNDIALS installation location.
3. Ensure the SUNDIALS libraries are in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
4. build the testSundials example:
   make all USE_SUNDIALS=TRUE (MPI=<TRUE,FALSE> HDF5=<TRUE,FALSE> DIM=<1,2,3>)
5. run the executable:
   ./testSundialsPDE<DIM>d.<config-string>.ex
6. output:
   (a) directs to stdout if serial, pout files if compiled with MPI
   (b) produces "file.<dim>d.hdf5" Chombo HDF5 file output.
