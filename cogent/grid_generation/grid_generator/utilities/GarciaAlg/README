The algorithm here replicates figure 2 from smoothndemo.m in a simplified 
case with: 
 
 a)no missing data, 
 b)the smoothing parameter specified by the user,
 c)the input data equally weighted,

The following command reads in a noisy file, noisyDataIn, writes out an hdf5
version of noisyDataIn, noisyFabIn, and also produces 10 smoothed versions 
in a directory called smoothFabsOut

smoothnDemo2d.Linux.64.g++.gfortran.OPT.ex input.smoothnDemo < noisyDataIn

The input file requires: info to create a range of smoothing parameters

Note: The first two entries of noisyFab in are required to be the (whole number) dimensions of the data
Note: The smoothing parameter should be between zero and one.
