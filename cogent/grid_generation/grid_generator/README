*This program creates an extended flux-aligned or de-aligned grids and

************************************
*How to run the grid-generator 
************************************

Provided python is available, run 

cd ../
python scripts/pyRun.py <DCT_file> <output_file>

This will run the grid generator and produce .pdf plots of the entire grid and 
all grid blocks (if requested). The plots are placed into the output folder

All input parameters are specified in the USER-SPECIFIED INPUT
portion of the pyRun.py script (top of of file). The pyRun.py script can also be used 
only for plotting purposes, if run_GridGenerator and smooth_Ghosts are both set to 0.


The grid generator can also be run directly as follows 

for de-algined grids (coarse and fine examples)

*************************************
*Utilities / how to create a DCT file
*************************************

The subfolder utilities contains matlab scripts to read g-eqdsk file,
extract the magnetic flux data, smooth it, and produce a DCT-file. smoothed
 of the g-eqdsk file, which contains the smoothed-psi is generated as well.

Example:

smooth_eqdsk('g153523.03745', 1000) 

will run the matlab script on the g-file g153523.03745 (currently exists in /utilities folder)
with the smoothing parameter s = 1000, and will produce two output files: 
g153523.03745_dct and g153523.03745_smoothed. This example should be run by setting 
zSmin = -1.3 in smooth_eqdsk.m in order to have smoothed psi structure in the bottom-left corner
(required later for longer-leg extrapolation in the above gridGenerator example). 

The smoothing occurs as a result of two steps:
(a) A least-square fit is obtained by making use of the RBF functions: I[n]/(r[n]+r0). 
(b) A robust smoothing algorithm [Garcia D, Computational Statistics & Data Analysis, 2009]
 is applied to the fit.


***********************************
*Additional general notes/comments:
***********************************

(1) Smooth_eqdsk computes Xpt for the smoothed geometry, but returns the magnetic 
axis location for the original geometry. 

(2) For the case of a fine poloidal mesh we may need to increase the number of radial cells
as well (see the high-resolution example). Otherwise, the radial gridlines launched from
the separatrix in the X-point vicinity may cross block cuts.


****************************************************
*How to view the output â€” OLD OPTION (STILL WORKS)
****************************************************

The output is dumped into /output folder, which also contains 
matlab scripts to view the results:

-Plot entire grid
plotEntireGrid() 

-Plot valid cells of a given block (e.g., block 1).
load coords1
plot_coords(coords1) 

-Plot extended grid for a given block (e.g., block 0)
load extended_coords0
plot_coords(extended_coords0)
