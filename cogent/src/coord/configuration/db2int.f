C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   DB2INT determines the parameters of a function that interpolates the
C   two-dimensional gridded data (X(i),Y(j),FCN(i,j)) for i=1,..,NX and
C   j=1,..,NY.  The interpolating function and its derivatives may be
C   subsequently evaluated by the function DB2VAL.
C
C   The interpolating function is a piecewise polynomial (pp) function
C   represented as a tensor product of one-dimensional B-splines.  The
C   form of this function is
C
C                          NX   NY
C              S(x,y)  =  SUM  SUM  a   U (x) V (y)
C                         i=1  j=1   ij  i     j
C
C   where the functions U(i) and V(j) are one-dimensional B-spline
C   basis functions. The coefficients a(i,j) are chosen so that
C
C         S(X(i),Y(j)) = FCN(i,j)   for i=1,..,NX and j=1,..,NY.
C
C   Note that for each fixed value of y S(x,y) is a pp function of x
C   alone, and for each fixed x S(x,y) is a pp function of y alone.  In
C   one dimension a piecewise polynomial may be created by partitioning
C   a given interval into subintervals and defining a distinct poly-
C   nomial on each one. The points where adjacent subintervals meet are
C   called  knots.  Each of the functions U(i) and V(j) above is a
C   piecewise polynomial.
C
C   Users of DB2INT choose the order (degree+1) of the polynomial pieces
C   used to define the interpolant in each of the x and y directions
C   (KX and KY). Users also may define their own knot sequence in x and
C   y separately (TX and TY).  If IFLAG=0, however, DB2INT will choose
C   knots that result in a pp interpolant with KX-2 continuous partial
C   derivatives in x and KY-2 continuous partial derivatives in y.  The
C   interpolating function is identically zero outside the rectangular
C   region defined by the knots. See below for more information on knot
C   selection.
C
C   After a call to DB2INT, all information necessary to define the
C   interpolating function is contained in the parameters NX, NY, KX,
C   KY, TX, TY, and FCN.  These quantities should not be altered until
C   after the last call of the evaluation routine DB2VAL.

C   ---------------------------
C
C   In this section we describe the relationship between data points
C   and knots.  Users who choose to let DB2INT select the knot sequences
C   TX and TY (by setting IFLAG=1) may skip this discussion.
C
C   To describe the relationship between knots and data points we  first
C   consider the simpler case of one-dimensional interpolation; in
C   particular, we consider interpolating the data X(i), i=1,..,N with
C   a pp function of order K.
C
C   Knots are the points where the individual polynomial pieces join up,
C   and hence where the pp function may suffer a loss of smoothness.  To
C   define a pp function, one needs N+K knots. If the knots are distinct
C   the interpolant will be as smooth as possible (continuous, with K-2
C   continuous derivatives).  If two adjacent knots come together, the
C   smoothness of the function is reduced at that point.  In general, if
C   M knots are assigned to the same point, the pp function will have
C   K-M-1 continuous derivatives there. If K knots are taken at the same
C   point, then the pp function itself will be discontinuous there.
C
C   Typically, K knots are taken at or to the left of the leftmost data
C   point, K knots at or to the right of the rightmost data point, with
C   the remaining N-K knots in between.  In order for there to be a
C   solution to the interpolation problem the knots T(i), must satisfy
C   certain additional constraints. That is,
C
C                T(i) .LT. X(i) .LT. T(i+K)   i=1,..,N
C
C   Equality is permitted on the left for I=1 and on the right for I=N.
C
C   The two-dimensional interpolant computed by this routine is a tensor
C   product of one-dimensional pp interpolants.  The knots form a grid
C   (TX(i),TY(j)) in the same way that the data points do.  Along lines
C   parallel to the coordinate axes, the interpolant reduces to a one-
C   dimensional pp function with order and knots (KX,TX) or (KY,TY). In
C   this case the appropriate constraints on the knots become
C
C            TX(i) .LT. X(i) .LT. TX(i+KX)   i=1,..,NX
C            TY(i) .LT. Y(i) .LT. TY(i+KY)   i=1,..,NY
C
C   with equality on the left permitted when i=1 and equality on the
C   right permitted when i=NX and i=NY, respectively.
C
C   If these conditions are violated, then DB2INT returns with IFLAG
C   equal to 6 or 10.  The default knot sequence selected by DB2INT
C   always satisfies these conditions.
C
C   When the user sets IFLAG=1 DB2INT selects knots as follows. KX knots
C   are taken at each endpoint in the x direction, not-a-knot end
C   conditions (see references) are used, and the remaining knots are
C   placed at data points if KX is even or at midpoints between data
C   points if KX is odd.  The y direction is treated similarly.  This
C   yields a two-dimensional pp function with KX-2 continuous partial
C   derivatives in x and KY-2 continuous partial derivatives in y.  The
C   interpolant is zero outside the rectangular region defined by the
C   data points, and discontinuous along the boundary of this region.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   DBKNOT is a subsidiary routine called by DB2INT and DB3INT.
C
C   DBKNOT selects a sequence of N+K knots for use in piecewise
C   polynomial interpolation of order K at a given set of N data points.
C
C   The knots T(i), i=1,..,N+K, are selected as follows:
C
C     number                    location
C     ----------------------------------------------------------------
C     K     at X(1)
C     N-K   between X(1+K/2) and X(N-K+K/2); these are placed at data
C           points if N is even and midway between data points if N is
C           odd
C     K     at X(N)
C
C   where X(i), i=1,..,N are the data points.
C
C   This selection yields an interpolant with K-2 continuous deriva-
C   tives, except at X(1) and X(N); the interpolant will be zero outside
C   (X(1),X(N)).  Knot-a-knot end conditions are used, resulting in K-1
C   continuous derivatives at T(K+1) and T(N).

C     Abstract
C
C         DBINTK is a modification of the SPLINT routine of reference
C         [de Boor 1979].
C
C         DBINTK produces the B-spline coefficients, BCOEF, of the
C         B-spline of order K with knots T(I), I=1,...,N+K, which
C         takes on the value Y(I) at X(I), I=1,...,N.  The spline or
C         any of its derivatives can be evaluated by calls to DB1VAL.
C
C         The I-th equation of the linear system A*BCOEF = B for the
C         coefficients of the interpolant enforces interpolation at
C         X(I), I=1,...,N.  Hence, B(I) = Y(I), for all I, and A is
C         a band matrix with 2K-1 bands if A is invertible.  The matrix
C         A is generated row by row and stored, diagonal by diagonal,
C         in the rows of Q, with the main diagonal going into row K.
C         The banded system is then solved by a call to DBNFAC (which
C         constructs the triangular factorization for A and stores it
C         again in Q), followed by a call to DBNSLV (which then
C         obtains the solution BCOEF by substitution).  DBNFAC does no
C         pivoting, since the total positivity of the matrix A makes
C         this unnecessary.  The linear system to be solved is
C         (theoretically) invertible if and only if
C                 T(I) .LT. X(I) .LT. T(I+K),        for all I.
C         Equality is permitted on the left for I=1 and on the right
C         for I=N when K knots are used at X(1) or X(N).  Otherwise,
C         violation of this condition is certain to lead to an error.
C
C     Description of Arguments
C
C         Input     (X,Y,T are double precision)
C           X      - vector of length N containing data point abscissae
C                    in strictly increasing order.
C           Y      - corresponding vector of length N containing data
C                    point ordinates.
C           T      - knot vector of length N+K
C                    Since T(1),..,T(K) .LE. X(1) and T(N+1),..,T(N+K)
C                    .GE. X(N), this leaves only N-K knots (not nec-
C                    essarily X(I) values) interior to (X(1),X(N))
C           N      - number of data points, N .GE. K
C           K      - order of the spline, K .GE. 1
C
C         Output    (BCOEF,Q,WORK are double precision)
C           BCOEF  - a vector of length N containing the B-spline
C                    coefficients
C           Q      - a work vector of length (2*K-1)*N, containing
C                    the triangular factorization of the coefficient
C                    matrix of the linear system being solved.  The
C                    coefficients for the interpolant of another data
C                    set (X(I),YY(I)), I=1,...,N, with the same
C                    abscissae can be obtained by loading YY into
C                    BCOEF and then executing
C                        CALL DBNSLV(Q,2K-1,N,K-1,K-1,BCOEF)
C           WORK   - work vector of length 2*K
C
C     Error Conditions
C         Improper input is a fatal error, as is a singular system of
C         equations.  Conditions checked and their XERMSG error numbers:
C               1   K is less than 1
C               2   N is less than K
C               3   X values are not distinct or not ordered
C               4   Some abscissa was not in the support of the corres-
C                   ponding basis function, and the system is singular.
C               8   The system solver has detected a singular system,
C                   although the theoretical conditions for a solution
C                   were satisfied.
C         Note: These numbers are printed by XERMSG, but not returned
C         to the calling program.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  DBNFAC is the BANFAC routine from
C        * A Practical Guide to Splines *  by C. de Boor
C
C  DBNFAC is a double precision routine
C
C  Returns in  W  the LU-factorization (without pivoting) of the banded
C  matrix  A  of order  NROW  with  (NBANDL + 1 + NBANDU) bands or diag-
C  onals in the work array  W .
C
C *****  I N P U T  ****** W is double precision
C  W.....Work array of size  (NROWW,NROW)  containing the interesting
C        part of a banded matrix  A , with the diagonals or bands of  A
C        stored in the rows of  W , while columns of  A  correspond to
C        columns of  W . This is the storage mode used in  LINPACK  and
C        results in efficient innermost loops.
C           Explicitly,  A  has  NBANDL  bands below the diagonal
C                            +     1     (main) diagonal
C                            +   NBANDU  bands above the diagonal
C        and thus, with    MIDDLE = NBANDU + 1,
C          A(I+J,J)  is in  W(I+MIDDLE,J)  for I=-NBANDU,...,NBANDL
C                                              J=1,...,NROW .
C        For example, the interesting entries of A (1,2)-banded matrix
C        of order  9  would appear in the first  1+1+2 = 4  rows of  W
C        as follows.
C                          13 24 35 46 57 68 79
C                       12 23 34 45 56 67 78 89
C                    11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99
C                    21 32 43 54 65 76 87 98
C
C        All other entries of  W  not identified in this way with an en-
C        try of  A  are never referenced .
C  NROWW.....Row dimension of the work array  W .
C        must be  .GE.  NBANDL + 1 + NBANDU  .
C  NBANDL.....Number of bands of  A  below the main diagonal
C  NBANDU.....Number of bands of  A  above the main diagonal .
C
C *****  O U T P U T  ****** W is double precision
C  IFLAG.....Integer indicating success( = 1) or failure ( = 2) .
C     If  IFLAG = 1, then
C  W.....contains the LU-factorization of  A  into a unit lower triangu-
C        lar matrix  L  and an upper triangular matrix  U (both banded)
C        and stored in customary fashion over the corresponding entries
C        of  A . This makes it possible to solve any particular linear
C        system  A*X = B  for  X  by a
C              CALL DBNSLV ( W, NROWW, NROW, NBANDL, NBANDU, B )
C        with the solution X  contained in  B  on return .
C     If  IFLAG = 2, then
C        one of  NROW-1, NBANDL,NBANDU failed to be nonnegative, or else
C        one of the potential pivots was found to be zero indicating
C        that  A  does not have an LU-factorization. This implies that
C        A  is singular in case it is totally positive .
C
C *****  M E T H O D  ******
C     Gauss elimination  W I T H O U T  pivoting is used. The routine is
C  intended for use with matrices  A  which do not require row inter-
C  changes during factorization, especially for the  T O T A L L Y
C  P O S I T I V E  matrices which occur in spline calculations.
C     The routine should NOT be used for an arbitrary banded matrix.

C
C     Abstract    **** a double precision routine ****
C         DBSPVN is the BSPLVN routine of the reference.
C
C         DBSPVN calculates the value of all (possibly) nonzero basis
C         functions at X of order MAX(JHIGH,(J+1)*(INDEX-1)), where T(K)
C         .LE. X .LE. T(N+1) and J=IWORK is set inside the routine on
C         the first call when INDEX=1.  ILEFT is such that T(ILEFT) .LE.
C         X .LT. T(ILEFT+1).  A call to DINTRV(T,N+1,X,ILO,ILEFT,MFLAG)
C         produces the proper ILEFT.  DBSPVN calculates using the basic
C         algorithm needed in DBSPVD.  If only basis functions are
C         desired, setting JHIGH=K and INDEX=1 can be faster than
C         calling DBSPVD, but extra coding is required for derivatives
C         (INDEX=2) and DBSPVD is set up for this purpose.
C
C         Left limiting values are set up as described in DBSPVD.

C          VNIKX   - vector of length K for spline values.
C          WORK    - a work vector of length 2*K
C          IWORK   - a work parameter.  Both WORK and IWORK contain
C                    information necessary to continue for INDEX = 2.
C                    When INDEX = 1 exclusively, these are scratch
C                    variables and can be used for other purposes.

C     Error Conditions
C         Improper input is a fatal error.
