<p>
This code solves a system corresponding to a discretization
of the biharmonic problem treated as a system of equations
on the unit square.  Specifically, instead of solving
Delta^2(u) = f with zero boundary conditions for u and
Delta(u), we solve the system A x = b, where
<p>
<center> A = [ Delta -I ; 0 Delta], x = [ u ; v] and b = [ 0 ; f]  
</center>
<p>                   
The corresponding boundary conditions are u = 0 and v = 0.
<p>
The domain is split into an N x N processor grid.  Thus, the
given number of processors should be a perfect square.
Each processor's piece of the grid has n x n cells with n x n
nodes. We use cell-centered variables, and, therefore, the
nodes are not shared. Note that we have two variables, u and
v, and need only one part to describe the domain. We use the
standard 5-point stencil to discretize the Laplace operators.
The boundary conditions are incorporated as in Example 3.
<p>
We recommend viewing Examples 3, 6 and 7 before this example.
<a href="ex10.cxx.html"><h2>Example 10</h2></a>
<p>
This code solves a system corresponding to a discretization
of the Laplace equation with zero boundary conditions on the
unit square. The domain is split into a n x n grid of
quadrilateral elements and each processors owns a horizontal
strip of size m x n, where m = n/nprocs. We use bilinear
finite element discretization, so there are nodes (vertices)
that are shared between neighboring processors. The Finite
Element Interface is used to assemble the matrix and solve
the problem. Nine different solvers are available.
