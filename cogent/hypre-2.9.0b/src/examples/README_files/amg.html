<a href="ex5.c.html"><h2>Example 5</h2></a>
<p>
This example solves the 2-D
Laplacian problem with zero boundary conditions
on an nxn grid.  The number of unknowns is N=n^2.
The standard 5-point stencil is used, and we solve
for the interior nodes only.
<p>
This example solves the same problem as Example 3.
Available solvers are AMG, PCG, PCG with AMG or
Parasails preconditioners, or Flexible GMRES with 
AMG preconditioner.
<a href="ex9.c.html"><h2>Example 9</h2></a>
<p>
This code solves a system corresponding to a discretization
of the biharmonic problem treated as a system of equations
on the unit square.  Specifically, instead of solving
Delta^2(u) = f with zero boundary conditions for u and
Delta(u), we solve the system A x = b, where
<p>
<center> A = [ Delta -I ; 0 Delta], x = [ u ; v] and b = [ 0 ; f]  
</center>
<p>                   
The corresponding boundary conditions are u = 0 and v = 0.
<p>
The domain is split into an N x N processor grid.  Thus, the
given number of processors should be a perfect square.
Each processor's piece of the grid has n x n cells with n x n
nodes. We use cell-centered variables, and, therefore, the
nodes are not shared. Note that we have two variables, u and
v, and need only one part to describe the domain. We use the
standard 5-point stencil to discretize the Laplace operators.
The boundary conditions are incorporated as in Example 3.
<p>
We recommend viewing Examples 3, 6 and 7 before this example.
<a href="ex12.c.html"><h2>Example 12</h2></a>
<p>
The grid layout is the same as ex1, but with nodal unknowns. The solver is PCG
preconditioned with either PFMG or BoomerAMG, selected on the command line.
<p>
We recommend viewing the Struct examples before viewing this and the other
SStruct examples.  This is one of the simplest SStruct examples, used primarily
to demonstrate how to set up non-cell-centered problems, and to demonstrate how
easy it is to switch between structured solvers (PFMG) and solvers designed for
more general settings (AMG).
<a href="ex13.c.html"><h2>Example 13</h2></a>
<p>
This code solves the 2D Laplace equation using bilinear finite element
discretization on a mesh with an "enhanced connectivity" point.  Specifically,
we solve -Delta u = 1 with zero boundary conditions on a star-shaped domain
consisting of identical rhombic parts each meshed with a uniform n x n grid.
Every part is assigned to a different processor and all parts meet at the
origin, equally subdividing the 2*pi angle there. The case of six processors
(parts) looks as follows:
<p>
<pre>
                                    +
                                   / \
                                  /   \
                                 /     \
                       +--------+   1   +---------+
                        \        \     /         /
                         \    2   \   /    0    /
                          \        \ /         /
                           +--------+---------+
                          /        / \         \
                         /    3   /   \    5    \
                        /        /     \         \
                       +--------+   4   +---------+
                                 \     /
                                  \   /
                                   \ /
                                    +
</pre>
<p>
Note that in this problem we use nodal variables, which will be shared between
the different parts, so the node at the origin, for example, will belong to all
parts.
<p>
We recommend viewing the Struct examples before viewing this and the other
SStruct examples.  The primary role of this particular SStruct example is to
demonstrate how to set up non-cell-centered problems, and specifically problems
with an "enhanced connectivity" point.
<a href="ex14.c.html"><h2>Example 14</h2></a>
<p>
This is a version of <a href="ex13.html">Example 13</a>, which uses the SStruct
FEM input functions instead of stencils to describe a problem on a mesh with an "enhanced
connectivity" point.  This is the recommended way to set up a finite element
problem in the SStruct interface.
<a href="ex16.c.html"><h2>Example 16</h2></a>
<p>
This code solves the 2D Laplace equation using a high order Q3 finite element
discretization.  Specifically, we solve -Delta u = 1 with zero boundary
conditions on a unit square domain meshed with a uniform grid.  The mesh is
distributed across an N x N process grid, with each processor containing an n x
n sub-mesh of data, so the global mesh is nN x nN.
