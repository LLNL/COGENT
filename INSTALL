Build hypre
-----------
A version of hypre is provided with the COGENT code.  To build it:

1) Enter the hypre directory:
 
     cd hypre-2.9.0b

2) Create a "doconfig" script to configure the hypre makefiles.  You can base 
   it off of one of the nearby scripts.  Name the new script something like 
   doconfig-MACHINE-CXX-F77-OPT, where CXX is the C++ compiler, F77 is the 
   fortran compiler, and OPT is either "dbg" or "opt".

3) Execute your new script:

     ./doconfig-MACHINE-CXX-F77-OPT

4) Build and install hypre:

     ./doinstall

5) Leave the hypre directory

     cd ..


Build COGENT
------------
We assume that Chombo is already installed in a directory called "Chombo".  
By default, it is assumed that Chombo is installed at the same level as 
"COGENT-0.9".  If this is not the case, modify the "CHOMBO_HOME" variable in 
GNUMakefile, GNUMakefile.multidim, and GNUmakefile.regression to point to the
location of your Chombo installation.

1) Enter the build directory:

     cd exec

2) Build COGENT:

     gmake -j4

   This should create an executable with a platform and compiler specific name,
   e.g., cogent.Linux.mpicpc.ifort.OPT.MPI.ex.
