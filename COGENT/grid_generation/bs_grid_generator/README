This directory contains:

I)sub-directories

II)script: totalRun.py and totalRun.inputs

III)GNUmakefile.multidim (because this was always here, and I'm not sure when/how it will be used)

I)Sub-Directories

  1) blocks/ contains 
     a)bs.cpp, the Brackbill-Salzman code  
     b)input.Brackbill-Salzman  
     c)diagnostic/ and outputMapping/
     
  2)checkpoint/ is where the different .cpp write checkpoint files
  
  3) ghostCellExtrapBS/ contains
   
    a) ghostCell.BS.10.block.cpp, which does a combination of extrapolation and Brackbill-Salzman smoothing on the ghost cells
    b) input.ghost and input.ghost.totalRun
    c) diagnostic/

  4) mappingFiles/ contains the ten-block map and DCT file that are the inputs to grid generation.

  5) magGeom/ contains magGeom.cpp and octave scripts, which we use to visualize the geometry as a whole.

  6) newBoundaryNodesIC/ contains
   
    a)newBdInit.cpp, which moves the boundary nodes and sets up an iniital condition for the Euler-Lagrange problem in the Brackbill-Salzman algorithm. 
    b)input.newBd and input.newBd.totalRun
    c)diagnostic/
    d)ResultsIC/, which will soon be renamed outputMapping/

  7)src/ contains FieldData and interpolation classes.

  8)utilities/ contains
    a)addMap.cpp which facilitates the parallelization strategy of calculating the maps on each block independently
    b) input.addMap and input.addMap.totalRun
    c) outputMapping 
             
II) script

 1) totalRun.py instantiates the complete algorithm:
   a) Move the boundary nodes
   b) Run Brackbill-Salzman (using 10 processes) on all blocks
   c) Combine the output of 10 processes into a single map
   d) Create ghost cells.

 2) totalRun.py uses input.totalRun to create Results/, which contains the final product and intermediate results. In particlar Results/ contains 

   a)block0/, block1/, ...,block9/. These directories resemble grid_generator/blocks/. However, blocks/ typically will contain information about any or all blocks,
     while the directories under Results are specific to a block.
   b)outputMapping/ contains the map that we will use for grid generation.
   c)directories analagous to those in grid_generator, which contain the intermediate results specific to the choices made in input.totalRun
    i  ) newBoundaryNodesIC/
    ii ) ghostCellExtrapBS/
    iii) utilities
  
   d) input.totalRun

III) Should we move GNUmakefile.multidim somewhere?
