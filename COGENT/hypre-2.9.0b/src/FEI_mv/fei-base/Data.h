/**
  This is a very simple class for passing stuff around
  in a void pointer. It has the ability to store and query
  a type name, so at least there can be user-enforced
  type safety.

  When setTypeName is called, a char* is created and a copy
  of the input argument is taken. This char* is later destroyed
  by the Data destructor. The void* dataPtr_ member is not
  destroyed, it is just a copy of a pointer.
