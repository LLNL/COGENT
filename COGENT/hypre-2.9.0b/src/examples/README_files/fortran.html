<a href="ex5f.f.html"><h2>Example 5 (Fortran version)</h2></a>
<p>
This example solves the 2-D
Laplacian problem with zero boundary conditions
on an nxn grid.  The number of unknowns is N=n^2.
The standard 5-point stencil is used, and we solve
for the interior nodes only.
<p>
This example solves the same problem as Example 3.
Available solvers are AMG, PCG, and PCG with AMG or
Parasails preconditioners.
<a href="ex5b77.f.html"><h2>Example 5 (Babel-based Fortran version)</h2></a>
<p>
This example solves the 2-D
Laplacian problem with zero boundary conditions
on an nxn grid.  The number of unknowns is N=n^2.
The standard 5-point stencil is used, and we solve
for the interior nodes only.
<p>
This example solves the same problem as Example 3.
Available solvers are AMG, PCG, and PCG with AMG or
Parasails preconditioners.
<a href="ex5b90.f90.html"><h2>Example 5 (Babel-based Fortran 90 version)</h2></a>
<p>
This example solves the 2-D
Laplacian problem with zero boundary conditions
on an nxn grid.  The number of unknowns is N=n^2.
The standard 5-point stencil is used, and we solve
for the interior nodes only.
<p>
This example solves the same problem as Example 3.
Available solvers are AMG, PCG, and PCG with AMG or
Parasails preconditioners.
<a href="ex6b77.f.html"><h2>Example 6 (Babel-based Fortran version)</h2></a>
<p>
This is a two processor example and is the same problem
as is solved with the structured interface in Example 2. 
(The grid boxes are exactly those in the example
diagram in the struct interface chapter of the User's Manual.
Processor 0 owns two boxes and processor 1 owns one box.)
This is the simplest sstruct example.  There is one part and 
one variable.  The solver is PCG with SMG preconditioner. We use a 
structured solver for this example.
<p>
We recommend comparing this example with Example 2.
<a href="ex12f.f.html"><h2>Example 12 (Fortran version)</h2></a>
<p>
The grid layout is the same as ex1, but with nodal unknowns. The solver is PCG
preconditioned with either PFMG or BoomerAMG, set in the code.
<p>
We recommend viewing the Struct examples before viewing this and the other
SStruct examples.  This is one of the simplest SStruct examples, used primarily
to demonstrate how to set up non-cell-centered problems, and to demonstrate how
easy it is to switch between structured solvers (PFMG) and solvers designed for
more general settings (AMG).
