<a href="ex5b.c.html"><h2>Example 5 (Babel-based C version)</h2></a>
<p>
This example solves the 2-D
Laplacian problem with zero boundary conditions
on an nxn grid.  The number of unknowns is N=n^2.
The standard 5-point stencil is used, and we solve
for the interior nodes only.
<p>
This example solves the same problem as Example 3.
Available solvers are AMG, PCG, and PCG with AMG or
Parasails preconditioners.
