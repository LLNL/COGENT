<h2> PCG-ParaSails Example Codes  </h2>

<a href="ex5.c.html"><h2>Example 5</h2></a>
<p>
This example solves the 2-D
Laplacian problem with zero boundary conditions
on an nxn grid.  The number of unknowns is N=n^2.
The standard 5-point stencil is used, and we solve
for the interior nodes only.
<p>
This example solves the same problem as Example 3.
Available solvers are AMG, PCG, PCG with AMG or
Parasails preconditioners, or Flexible GMRES with 
AMG preconditioner.
<a href="ex10.cxx.html"><h2>Example 10</h2></a>
<p>
This code solves a system corresponding to a discretization
of the Laplace equation with zero boundary conditions on the
unit square. The domain is split into a n x n grid of
quadrilateral elements and each processors owns a horizontal
strip of size m x n, where m = n/nprocs. We use bilinear
finite element discretization, so there are nodes (vertices)
that are shared between neighboring processors. The Finite
Element Interface is used to assemble the matrix and solve
the problem. Nine different solvers are available.
